	--------------------------
	|From: Tom Zanussi <tom.zanussi@linux.intel.com>
	|Date: Mon, 15 Jan 2018 20:51:41 -0600
	|Subject: [PATCH 15/48] tracing: Add timestamp_mode trace file
	|
	|Add a new option flag indicating whether or not the ring buffer is in
	|'absolute timestamp' mode.
	|
	|Currently this is only set/unset by hist triggers that make use of a
	|common_timestamp.  As such, there's no reason to make this writeable
	|for users - its purpose is only to allow users to determine
	|unequivocally whether or not the ring buffer is in that mode (although
	|absolute timestamps can coexist with the normal delta timestamps, when
	|the ring buffer is in absolute mode, timestamps written while absolute
	|mode is in effect take up more space in the buffer, and are not as
	|efficient).

	|From: Julia Cartwright <julia@ni.com>
	|Date: Mon, 7 May 2018 08:58:56 -0500
	|Subject: [PATCH] locallock: provide {get,put}_locked_ptr() variants
	|
	|Provide a set of locallocked accessors for pointers to per-CPU data;
	|this is useful for dynamically-allocated per-CPU regions, for example.
	|
	|These are symmetric with the {get,put}_cpu_ptr() per-CPU accessor
	|variants.
